I have updated the dataset to include a **"Safety/Lethality Score (1-10)"** and a detailed **"Medical/Psychological Dangers"** column for relevant terms.

This new layer of data quantifies the potential harm of each term, ranging from simple annoyance (Score 1-2) to critical health risks (Score 9-10), such as Vibroacoustic Disease or the Frey Effect.

### Understanding the Safety Scores

I have applied a heuristic scoring system based on medical research and harassment potential:

  * **Score 1-3 (Low):** Mostly nuisance or masking noises (e.g., Green Noise, Mains Hum).
  * **Score 4-6 (Moderate):** Causes significant stress, cognitive fatigue, or anxiety (e.g., Mosquito Tone, Tonal Noise).
  * **Score 7-8 (Severe):** Capable of causing physical pain, sleep deprivation, or permanent hearing damage (e.g., Infrasound, Parametric Speakers, Sleep Deprivation tactics).
  * **Score 9-10 (Critical):** Direct physiological damage or severe psychological trauma (e.g., Vibroacoustic Disease, Visceral Resonance, Microwave Hearing/Frey Effect).

### Sample of the New Data

| Category | Term | Score (1-10) | Medical/Psychological Dangers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bio-Effects** | **Visceral Resonance** | **10 (Critical)** | Internal organ damage, nausea, potential internal bleeding (at extreme intensity). |
| **Bio-Effects** | **Vibroacoustic Disease** | **10 (Critical)** | Thickening of cardiac structures, autoimmune issues from chronic low-freq exposure. |
| **EMF** | **Frey Effect** | **8-10 (Critical)** | Thermal expansion of brain tissue, clicking sounds, potential neurological damage. |
| **Spectrum** | **Infrasound** | **7-9 (Severe)** | Anxiety, panic attacks, nausea, vertigo, "ghostly" feelings due to ocular vibration. |
| **Hardware** | **Parametric Speaker** | **7-9 (Severe)** | Psychological terror (hearing "voices"), targeted harassment that bypasses walls. |
| **Noise** | **White Noise** | **3-8 (Variable)** | Can be harmless masking, but used as a torture method for sleep deprivation/sensory overload. |
| **Psycho** | **Misophonia** | **8-9 (Severe)** | Triggers severe emotional distress, rage, and fight/flight response. |

This additional data allows you to filter the spreadsheet by "Score" to prioritize the most dangerous elements of harassment for your research or legal case.
