## Summary of New Sections

To help you navigate the expanded data, here is a breakdown of the new categories added:

Psychoacoustics (How the brain perceives sound):

Includes terms like Binaural Beats and Shepard Tones (auditory illusions that can induce anxiety or specific brain states).

Masking and The Haas Effect, explaining how harassment sounds can be hidden or made difficult to locate.

Hyperacusis and Misophonia, covering the medical sensitivity often weaponized or exacerbated in these scenarios.

Physics & Environment (How sound moves):

Standing Waves and Room Modes: Explains why a noise might be loud in one corner of a room but silent in another (often confusing victims).

Structure-borne Noise: Differentiates between air noise and vibrations traveling through walls/floors (e.g., shakers/transducers).

Constructive Interference: How two sources can combine to create a "hot spot" of loud noise.

Advanced Equipment:

Parametric Speakers (Audio Spotlighting): Devices that beam sound like a laser, allowing a target to hear it while others nearby cannot.

Bone Conduction: How sound can bypass the ears and be perceived "inside the head" via vibration.

EMF/Signal Processing:

Mains Hum (50/60Hz) vs. Dirty Electricity: Distinguishing between normal electrical noise and induced interference.

The Frey Effect: The perception of clicking/buzzing caused by pulsed RF frequencies (microwave hearing).

Measurement & Legal:

dBC vs dBA: Explains why standard "A-weighted" meters might fail to detect low-frequency harassment (bass/vibration) because they filter it out.

Noise Floor: The concept of baseline silence, crucial for proving the existence of intrusive noise.
