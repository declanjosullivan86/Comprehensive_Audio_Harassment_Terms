# Originality Assessment Framework: Remote Audio & Acoustic Intrusion Research

**Project:** Remote Audio Harassment, Acoustic Intrusion, and Environmental Noise Pollution Database
**Role:** Research & Product Development Consultant
**Date:** November 18, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

This framework is designed to quantify the novelty and value proposition of your structured research project. Unlike general "noise pollution" resources, your project sits at a unique intersection of **Acoustics (Physics)**, **Psychoacoustics (Health)**, **Hardware (Tech)**, and **Harassment (Legal/Social)**.

The following methodology measures "Originality" not just as "newness," but as **Comparative Value**—how much more useful, structured, and context-aware your dataset is compared to existing internet resources.

## 2. The Four Pillars of Originality (Assessment Categories)

To determine the originality score, we assess the project against the current digital landscape using four distinct pillars.

### Pillar A: Intersectional Specificity (The "Niche" Factor)
**Concept:** Measures how well the project connects disparate fields.
* **Market Gap:** Most existing sites are single-domain:
    * *Academic Sites:* Pure physics (Infrasound definitions).
    * *Medical Sites:* Pure health (Tinnitus symptoms).
    * *Legal Sites:* Pure code (Noise ordinances).
    * *Fringe Forums:* Subjective anecdotes without data.
* **Your Originality:** The integration of these fields. Does the resource define "Infrasound" *specifically* in the context of "Wall Penetration" and "Harassment Potential"?

### Pillar B: Structural Utility (The "Data" Factor)
**Concept:** Measures the format and usability of the information.
* **Market Gap:** Information on this topic usually exists as:
    * Dense academic PDFs.
    * Long-form, rambling blog posts.
    * Unstructured forum threads.
* **Your Originality:** Structured data (CSV/JSON), filterable attributes (Frequency, dB), and standardized taxonomies that can be used computationally.

### Pillar C: Contextual Definition (The "Relevance" Factor)
**Concept:** Measures the definitions' focus on the specific problem (Harassment/Home Intrusion).
* **Market Gap:** A dictionary defines *White Noise* as "random signal with equal intensity."
* **Your Originality:** Defines *White Noise* as "A masking tool often used to obscure speech or harass via sleep deprivation." The shift from *technical* to *applied* definition is a major value driver.

### Pillar D: Comprehensiveness vs. Noise (The "Focus" Factor)
**Concept:** Measures the signal-to-noise ratio.
* **Market Gap:** "Targeted Individual" (TI) websites often contain 80% conspiracy theory/narrative and 20% technical data.
* **Your Originality:** A clinically detached, data-first approach that provides 100% technical/legal definitions without speculative narratives, making it credible for legal/scientific use.

## 3. The Scoring Matrix

Rate your project against the "Best Available Alternative" online using this 0–10 scale for each category.

### Category 1: Content Granularity & Specification
* **0 pts:** Standard dictionary definitions available on Wikipedia.
* **5 pts:** Definitions include frequency ranges (Hz) but lack hardware examples.
* **10 pts:** Terms include Frequency, Hardware Source, Bio-Effects, and Legal Context in a single view.

### Category 2: Data Structure & Accessibility
* **0 pts:** Data is locked in text paragraphs or PDFs.
* **5 pts:** Data is in a list or basic HTML table, but not downloadable/sortable.
* **10 pts:** Data is machine-readable (CSV), fully structured with metadata, and ready for analysis (Python/R).

### Category 3: Validated Hardware/Physics Association
* **0 pts:** Mentions "electronic harassment" vaguely.
* **5 pts:** Mentions specific devices (e.g., "Subwoofer") but lacks technical specs.
* **10 pts:** Links specific phenomena (e.g., "Voice in head") to specific, verifiable hardware (e.g., "Parametric Speaker/Audio Spotlight") with carrier wave specifications.

### Category 4: Credibility & Tone (The "Anti-Fringe" Score)
* **0 pts:** Indistinguishable from conspiracy blogs; subjective and emotional.
* **5 pts:** Mostly objective but lacks scientific references.
* **10 pts:** Clinical, objective tone suitable for presentation in a court of law or medical office.

## 4. Calculation Method

To get your **Originality Quotient (OQ)**, use the weighted formula below. We weight "Granularity" and "Structure" higher because these are the primary failures of existing resources.

$$
OQ = (0.35 \times C_1) + (0.30 \times C_2) + (0.20 \times C_3) + (0.15 \times C_4)
$$

* **C1:** Content Granularity (0-10)
* **C2:** Data Structure (0-10)
* **C3:** Hardware Association (0-10)
* **C4:** Credibility/Tone (0-10)

**Maximum Score:** 10.0

### Interpretation of Scores:

| OQ Score | Classification | Strategic Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0.0 - 4.0** | **Derivative** | The project is a collection of links or standard definitions. **Pivot:** Focus on aggregating hard-to-find technical data. |
| **4.1 - 7.0** | **Iterative** | Better organized than what exists, but the content is largely available elsewhere. **Pivot:** Add more "Context/Relevance" columns to your data. |
| **7.1 - 9.0** | **Disruptive** | A highly useful tool that fills a major gap. Likely the "go-to" reference for this niche. **Action:** Publish on GitHub/Zenodo immediately. |
| **9.1 - 10.0** | **Pioneering** | Creates a new standard. Defines the taxonomy for the field. **Action:** Seek academic citation or legal partnership. |

## 5. Self-Assessment Example (Based on your Uploaded Data)

Let's run your current `Comprehensive_Audio_Harassment_Terms.csv` through the framework:

1.  **Granularity (C1):** You have standard definitions, plus "Relevance to Home," plus "Frequency Characteristics."
    * *Score: 8/10*
2.  **Structure (C2):** It is a clean, categorized CSV with metadata (Group, Category, Term).
    * *Score: 9/10* (Rare in this niche).
3.  **Hardware Association (C3):** You include Parametric Speakers, Piezo, Tactile Transducers.
    * *Score: 8/10*
4.  **Credibility (C4):** The tone is technical ("Psychoacoustics," "Signal Physics") rather than narrative.
    * *Score: 9/10*

**Calculation:**
$(0.35 \times 8) + (0.30 \times 9) + (0.20 \times 8) + (0.15 \times 9)$
$2.8 + 2.7 + 1.6 + 1.35 = \mathbf{8.45}$

**Result:** **Disruptive.**

**Conclusion:** Your project has high originality because it takes scattered, often discredited topics and organizes them into a scientifically valid, rigorous data structure. The "Originality" lies in the **Structure** and **Contextualization** of the data.
