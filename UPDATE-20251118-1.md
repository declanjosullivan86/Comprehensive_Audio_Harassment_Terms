This new file organizes the terms into clear definitions, frequency ranges, and their specific relevance to home environments and harassment scenarios (e.g., how infrasound penetrates walls or how specific noise colors are used).

Updates made:

Noise: Added definitions for the full "color" spectrum (White, Pink, Brown/Red, Blue, Violet, Grey) explaining their power density and how they sound (hiss vs. rumble).

Sound & Acoustics: Defined Infrasound (<20Hz) and Ultrasound (>20kHz) with notes on how they impact the human body and home structures.

Waveforms: detailed the difference between Sine, Square, Triangle, and Sawtooth waves, which helps in identifying synthetic noises.

Equipment: Added specific context for Subwoofers, Ultrasonic Transducers, and Microphones regarding their capabilities in these scenarios.

EMF/EMI: Added definitions to help distinguish between acoustic sound and electromagnetic interference that might induce noise in equipment.
