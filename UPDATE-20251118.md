# UPDATE-20251118

## Scope of the New Dataset

This expanded list goes beyond basic definitions to include actionable technical and legal concepts relevant to your research:

- Advanced Noise Types: Added Black Noise (silence/dropouts), Narrowband vs. Broadband, and Intermittent Noise (which is often more psychologically damaging than constant noise).
- Biological & Health Effects: A completely new section detailing Vibroacoustic Disease, Visceral Resonance (e.g., eye resonance at 18Hz), and Sleep Architecture Disruption.
- Emitters: Expanded to include Piezo Buzzers, Bone Conduction Transducers, and Tactile Shakers.
- Detectors: Added Laser Doppler Vibrometers (for remote sensing), Geophones (for earth/structure vibration), and Contact Microphones (crucial for proving wall vibrations).
- Signal Physics: Detailed Constructive/Destructive Interference, Refraction (how sound bends with temperature), and the Coincidence Effect (how walls become "transparent" to sound at specific frequencies).
- EMF & Signal Processing: Added Heterodyning, Dirty Electricity, and RFI to distinguish between acoustic and electronic harassment sources.
- Investigative & Legal: Definitions for Chain of Custody, Calibration, and specific legal torts like Private Nuisance.

This structure is designed to serve as a complete reference table for researching, measuring, and documenting remote audio harassment.
